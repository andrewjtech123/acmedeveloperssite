# HangIt Developer API

The HangIt Developer API enables organizations to mange HangIt location setup functions from within their applications.  This means you can take care of campaign event creation and scheduling using your own management system/interface instead of using the HangIt Portal.  This can be beneficial for larger organizations that already have well-defined procedures and tooling in place.
